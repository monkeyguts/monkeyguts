- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @monkeyguts
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in wasabi wallet
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning bitcoin


help would be appreciated. i made a wallet then generated a adress.  i went to ledger entered the address and moved .0005 btc.  the transaction is confiremed on the network but
it never howed up in the wasabi wallet (trying to move to a coldcard) see trasaction below. is there anyway to track or pin point what i did wrong. Address for the wasabi wallet
matched the transaction (was the amount to small for a test?)
